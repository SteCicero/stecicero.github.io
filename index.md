My name is Stefano Cicero, I was born in Oristano (Italy), in 1987. Since I had my first PC in 1999, my main interest has always been information technology. After high school I began studying Computer Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english">University of Pisa</a>, this provided me a deep all-around knowledge about ICT thematics. While studying I also worked for 3 years as web developer and sysadmin for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nic.it/en">.it Registry</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnr.it/en">National Research Council (CNR)</a> in Pisa. Currently Iâ€™m a Junior Consultant working as Embedded Software Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leonardocompany.com/en">Leonardo S.p.a.</a>
