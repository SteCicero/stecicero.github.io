In this project we face the problem of predicting the energy consumption required to heat up or cool down a space used as an office inside a building. To solve this problem we used computational intelligence techniques (e.g. neural network time series, fuzzy logic).

This project has been developed as final project for the intelligent systems exam, part of the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
