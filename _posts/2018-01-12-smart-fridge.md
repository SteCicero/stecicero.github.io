In this project we face the problem of designing a smart fridge which keeps track of foods expiry date to avoid food waste trough RFID tags. We’ll also try to find a solution to reduce the energy consumption of this product.

The Smart Fridge has been done as final project for the embedded systems design exam, part of the computer engineering master’s degree program at University of Pisa.
