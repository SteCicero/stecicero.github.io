In this project we face the problem of modeling and evaluating the performance of a multiprogrammed server which provides services to n concurrent clients. The performance are evaluated in terms of number of processed requests per second. The system has been modeled and simulated in <a href="https://www.omnetpp.org/" target="_blank">OMNeT++</a>.

This project has been developed as final project for the exam of Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems and Networks in the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
