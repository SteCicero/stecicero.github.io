My XmlTv is a web application that shows the broadcast programming for the next 24h of the selected TV channels belonging to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI" target="_blank">RAI Network</a>. It also allows to download the broadcast programming by generating a xmltv file format. The site has been tested with the following browsers: Safari 5, Firefox 3.6, Internet Explorer 8, Opera 10. Since the application has never been updated, it may not work properly nowadays (browser incompatibility, changes to external data source).

My XmlTv has been developed as final project for the web programming exam, part of the Computer Engineering bachelorâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
