In this project we analyzed the Intel Core i7 3960X architecture, an high-end hexa-core microprocessor introduced by Intel in late 2011. We made a report where we show the enhancement from the previous architectures, some of the Intel’s proprietary technologies and the architectural aspects from a developer point of view. Furthermore we made another report dedicated only to the cache of this microprocessor. 

These reports has been made as final project for the computer architectures exam in the Computer Engineering master’s degree program at University of Pisa.
