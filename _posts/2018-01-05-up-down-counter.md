In this project we face the problem of designing a mod 4 up/down counter. The solution is explained in the documentation and its structure is given in the VHDL hardware description language.

This design problem has been solved as final project for the electronic devices exam, part of the Computer Engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
