This project consists on programming two <a href="http://www.evidence.eu.com/" target="_blank">Evidence</a> FLEX Mini kit boards in order to display the wireless signal strength on a soldered led array on one of the two boards. These devices communicates trough the MiWi P2P wireless protocol and runs the Erika Enterprise Kernel. They have been programmed through the MPLAB ICD 2 programmer.

This project has been developed as final project for the real time systems exam, part of the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
