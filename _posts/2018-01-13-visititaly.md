VisitItaly is an iOS application which dynamically shows context aware informations (text and images) of various cultural sites (e.g. museums). Context awareness is obtained through the iBeacon technology.

VisitItaly has been developed as final project for the exams of Mobile and Pervasive Systems in the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
