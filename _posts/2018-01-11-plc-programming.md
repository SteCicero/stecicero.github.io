In this project I solved various exercises about programming a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). The systems to control and the PLC are simulated trough an application called <a href="http://www.thelearningpit.com/" target="_blank">LogixPro 500</a>.

This project has been done as final project for the embedded systems design exam, part of the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
