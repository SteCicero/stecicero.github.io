Cookies are small text files that websites send to and store on the user’s computer or mobile device. These files are then resent to the websites the next time they are visited by the user. Cookies are used to remember the user’s actions and preferences (such as login data, selected language, font size, other display settings, etc.) so that these do not have to be reset when the user returns to the website or browses the website pages. Therefore, cookies are used to for authentication and session monitoring purposes as well as to store information concerning the activities of users who access a website, and may also contain a unique identification code that makes it possible to track the user’s browsing history on the website itself for statistical or advertising purposes. When browsing a website, users can receive cookies on their computer or mobile device from websites or web servers different than the ones being visited (so-called third-party cookies).In certain cases, cookies are technically necessary for website operation, and as such, certain operations cannot be performed without these

There are various types of cookies, which vary according to characteristics and functions, and these can remain in the user’s computer or mobile device for different periods of time: so-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted when the browser is closed and persistent (or stored) cookies, which remain in the user’s device until the predefined expiration date.

In accordance with current regulations in Italy, the user is not always required to provide express consent for the use of cookies. Specifically, technical cookies used for the exclusive purpose of transmitting information across an electronic communications network, or those strictly necessary for providing a service specifically requested by the user –in other words cookies which are  crucial for website operation or essential in order to allow the user to perform certain activities – do not require consent.

Similarly to the technical cookies referred to above, which do not require express user consent, “analytics cookies” are also used directly by the website operator (these are also known as first-party or proprietary cookies). This type of cookie permits the website to collect information, in aggregate form, on the number of users who visit the site and the methods through which they do so – or, where these are provided by third parties, when instruments have been adopted in order to reduce ease of identification (for example, by masking a significant portion of the IP address). In addition, “functional cookies” allow users to browse in accordance with selected criteria (language, products selected for purchase, etc.), and are used in order to improve the service provided.

Conversely, “profiling cookies”, which are used to create user profiles and send advertising materials which correspond with the preferences demonstrated by the user while browsing online do require prior user consent.
